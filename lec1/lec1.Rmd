# The Knitting process

When we knitr the Rmd document, R generates md file, and it will be passed to pandoc!

# Code chunks

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulyngs/rmarkdown-workshop-2019/master/slides/figures/chunk-parts.png)
---

# Some chunk options

- `echo`: whether or not to display code in knitted output
- `eval`: whether or to to run the code in the chunk when knitting
- `include`: whether to include anything from the from a code chunk in the output document

---
# Setup chunk

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
# don't show code unless we explicitly set echo = TRUE
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
````

- Normally, an R Markdown document starts with a chunk that's used to set some options and load required libraries.

- `knitr::opts_chunk$set` sets default options for all chunks.

# Inline code

Inside your text you can include code with the syntax <span>&#96;</span>&nbsp; r code here&#96; &nbsp;.

For example, <span>&#96;</span>&nbsp; r 4 + 4&#96; &nbsp; would output `r 4 + 4` in your text. 

```{r, echo = TRUE}
dim(diamonds)
num_diamonds <- nrow(diamonds)
```

.pull-left[
There are <span>&#96;</span>&nbsp; r num_diamonds&#96;  &nbsp; rows in the `diamonds` dataset.

.pull-right[
There are `r num_diamonds` rows in the `diamonds` dataset.

# Inline code with python

At the moment, syntax like <span>&#96;</span>&nbsp; python code here&#96; &nbsp; is not valid. However, you can use the [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html) package to access variables from python chunks.

````markdown
`r ''````{python}
my_number = 4 + 8
```
````

```{python echo=FALSE}
my_number = 4 + 8
```

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
library(reticulate)
py$my_number
```
````

```{r}
py$my_number
```

`my_number` can be referred inline by <span>&#96;</span>&nbsp; r py$my_number&#96;&nbsp;.

# Useful tips

---
# Very Important

`Alt` + `Shift` + `K` shows all shortcuts! However, some are USEFUL, some are **NOT**!

### Useful **Shortcuts!**

.pull-left[

add `%>%` operator: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `m`

add `<-` operator: `Alt` + -

add cursors! : `Ctrl` + `Alt` + down or up

search functions: `Ctrl` + .

search commands: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `p`

]
.pull-right[

Run current chunk: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `c`

R code re-formatting: `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `a`

Copy current below: `Shift` + `Alt` + down

Insert `R` code chunk: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + i

]

---
# Very Very Important

Modify and Make your own shortcuts!

`Tools` > `Modify Keyboard Shortcuts` will open another door to you.

For example,

* Insert `python` code: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + p

* Insert snippet: `Shift` + `Space`

---
# $Very^\infty$ Important

**Snippet** save your time, almost 1 year during your whole life, no joke.

.pull-left[
### What the hack is snippet
* **Text macros** that are used for quickly inserting common snippets of code

* `Tools` > `Global option` > `Code` > `Snippet`

* Some people know there are *code snippet* in Rstudio

# Set up GitHub 

* Using GitHub in this lecture for **version control** and **publishing**.

* Sign up for a GitHub.com account at https://github.com/join

* Complete these installation instructions.

* Test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following these steps.

  * you choose HTTPS over SSH, and
  * you setup a GitHub Personal Access Token.

---
# Check out your default branch

* `main` as the default branch for all new repositories

* To check this, for user accounts, go to: https://github.com/settings/repositories

* You should see something like this:

```{r chunkname, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./mainbranch.jpg")
```

If yours still says master, you may change it to main here if you wish.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(distill)
create_website(dir = ".", title = "iyo-distill", gh_pages = TRUE)
```

1. Build site 

* Close the RStudio IDE and re-open it. Look in your Git pane, you should see a .Rproj file has changed:

* Hit Build tab, and build your first website!

---
# Polish the main site

Use `postcard` package to polish the main site.

* `index.Rmd` file YMAL
